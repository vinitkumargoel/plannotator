# Plannotator for Codex

Code review and markdown annotation are supported today. Plan mode is not yet supported — it requires hooks to intercept the agent's plan submission, which Codex does not currently expose.

## Install

**macOS / Linux / WSL:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinitkumargoel/plannotator/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinitkumargoel/plannotator/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

## Usage

### Code Review

Run `!plannotator review` to open the code review UI for your current changes:

```
!plannotator review
```

This captures your git diff, opens a browser with the review UI, and waits for your feedback. When you submit annotations, the feedback is printed to stdout.

### Annotate Markdown

Run `!plannotator annotate` to annotate any markdown file:

```
!plannotator annotate path/to/file.md
```

### Annotate Last Message

Run `!plannotator last` to annotate the agent's most recent response:

```
!plannotator last
```

The message opens in the annotation UI where you can highlight text, add comments, and send structured feedback back to the agent.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PLANNOTATOR_REMOTE` | Set to `1` / `true` for remote mode, `0` / `false` for local mode, or leave unset for SSH auto-detection. Uses a fixed port in remote mode; browser-opening behavior depends on the environment. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_PORT` | Fixed port to use. Default: random locally, `19432` for remote sessions. |
| `PLANNOTATOR_BROWSER` | Custom browser to open. macOS: app name or path. Linux/Windows: executable path. |
